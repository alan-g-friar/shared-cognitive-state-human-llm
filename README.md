> *Shared Cognitive State in Human–LLM Interaction: Failure Modes, Risk Surfaces, and Structural Implications*

The paper defines the structural risks that emerge when multiple human participants and one or more Large Language Models (LLMs) operate within a shared conversational context. It focuses on failures introduced by shared cognitive state itself, rather than model architecture, training methods, or implementation detail.

This work is design-oriented and informational in nature. It does not propose a product, benchmark, or implementation roadmap.
